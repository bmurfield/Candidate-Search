# Candidate-Search

## Description

An application to search github pages for job candidates

* I wanted to make a webpage that allows the user to view github pages to find candidates for a job. 

* When the user selects the + button the cadidate is saved to the Potentail Canditates table for future viewing and reference.

* Each candidates profile links to their github page and contains information about them like their username and profile picture.

* In this project I worked with REact and TypeScript and learned how to use an API token to retrieve information.

Once on the page the user is presented with potential candidates. The user can press the + to save a user to the table and the - button to skip to the next candidate.

## Usage

This website can be used to find a candiate for a job by being presented with many github user pages.
